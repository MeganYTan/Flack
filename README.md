# Flack

## Description
Flack, aka Fake Slack, is a channel based chat app created for CS50 web's project2 that is made to imitate Slack. It can be accessed through [this link] (https://meganytan-flack.herokuapp.com/). 

## How it works
Upon first entering the website, the user will be prompted to choose a display name. The user can then create channels, select channels, and send and receive messages in the channel. When the user returns to the website, the last channel that they were in wil be displayed. For my personal touch, the user is able to delete the messages that they sent.
